### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pam and am currently working on my PhD in Higher Education part time. :turtle:

:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Slow is an understatement for the pace I'm learning R and Git, but I guess we all have to start somewhere! 

:dog: I recently adopted a dog I was fostering, and have realized he's training me and not the other way around.
